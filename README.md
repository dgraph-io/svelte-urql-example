# Book review app

This app was made for the blog, in which we learn "How to build a book review app with Svelte, urql and Slash GraphQL".

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/svelte-urql-example.git
cd svelte-urql-example
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-urql-example
npm install
```

Edit `src/App.svelte`, on line 12 replace "YOUR-SLASH-ENDPOINT" with your Slash GraphQL endpoint.

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. 

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
